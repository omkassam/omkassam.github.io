My name is Omar Kassam and I'm a Musician and Filmmaker from the UK!</p><p>Music has been a passion of mine from an early age, and I've always loved to sing and play.</p><p>I've been playing the Piano since I was six years old and I'm Grade 4 level, soon to start working on Grade 5! I first picked up a guitar at the age of 2, and instantly fell in love! I've owned a guitar pretty much my whole life, but only started taking lessons in 2019. I'm currently working towards Grade 3.</p><p>Music Production is something that I've always found interesting. I absolutely love just messing around with all the different sounds, adding effects and making cool sounds!</p><p>Filmmaking is another passion of mine. It's amazing what you can do with software! Currently during the Covid lockdown period I have been producing a number of videos for my school, which has really helped to improve my skill! At the time of writing my dream career is to become a film editor at a large movie company like Disney or Illumination.</p><footer><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="twitter.com/omkassam" class="twitter" aria-label="Twitter"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://omarkassam.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="instagram.com/omkassam" class="instagram" aria-label="Instagram"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://omarkassam.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbdj3WkKHIFdJ2q_lj4G0-Q" class="youtube" aria-label="Youtube"><svg class="icon"><use xlink:href="https://omarkassam.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#youtube"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">Omar Kassam 2021</div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://omarkassam.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=babd20e2a0a25821e63a0529c9feaae0"></script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
